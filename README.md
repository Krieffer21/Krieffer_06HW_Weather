## Weather Api
  This assigment was to create a weather application the gave the current days weather along with a 5 day forecast. The user is able to search for a city and see the weather results, and click on prior searches. The cities the user searches for needed to be saved to local storage. I used the weather api, and a time/ date api to call on to get the required informaiton.
